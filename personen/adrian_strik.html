The food itself was generally unaccustomed to European tastes, mainly mutton, something no-one had ever eaten in Holland - as well as completely new, unknown things like jelly - and something called ‘junket’! The result was that many families resorted to cooking their meals, on primitive kerosine burners and the like. This was quickly banned, due to the fire hazard."</em></p></p>
