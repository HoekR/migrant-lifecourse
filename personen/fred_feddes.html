Under the guise of a summer holiday they investigated the options of moving there themselves. Two years later they decided to move to Australia.</p><p><em></em></p></p>

The CEC had application centers and did the pre-selection in the Netherlands. Once selected the application file was sent to the Nederlandse Emigratie Dienst (Netherlands Emigration Service) and the Australian immigration officers, who did the final selection. The CEC also got them in contact with fellow church people in Australia who could offer practical advice and help.<a href="https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=7203015" target="image" rel="noopener"> more info</a></p><p><em></em></p></p>
