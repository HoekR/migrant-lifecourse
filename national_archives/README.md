This is an example scraper for the Dutch Bonegilla files at the National Archives Australia. 
It leans heavily on https://wragge.github.io/recordsearch_data_scraper/
and most of the code is taken from 
https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/recordsearch/blob/master/harvesting_items_from_a_search.ipynb

use it for documentation.

The slugify package seems to be Python2.7 only, so I adapted it slight to work with Python3. Probably including it in the directory (as I did in Github) should work as is.
